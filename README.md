**Tableau public interactive Dashboard:** [https://public.tableau.com/views/WieschnellfhrtderZug/Dashboard?:language=es-ES&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link]

**Background:**

The following Dashboard is about the trains in Germany from the Deutschebahn company, where the mapped routes allow you to see how fast the trains are on the respective segments.
This is an Exploratory dashboard, which means it doesn't answer any specific question. Instead, it is a tool that lets the audience search for their own answers.
